## Roles and Permisssions 
Each role in Genesys Cloud contains one or more permissions. The permissions allow users with that role to do various tasks, such as create groups, set up integrations, and supervise contact center activity.

The Employee role has the lowest level of permissions and is assigned to all users. This role cannot be removed. A user must be assigned additional roles by a Genesys Cloud Administrator to have additional permissions.
The Admin role has permissions to make any changes to a Genesys Cloud organization. This role is automatically assigned to whoever sets up the organization. This person is responsible for inviting others to a Genesys Cloud organization and for assigning roles to invitees.
