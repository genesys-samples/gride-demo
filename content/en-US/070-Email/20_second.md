## Test an Email Interaction

1. The first step in testing an email interaction is ensuring you have the correct email address. Navigate to **Admin** page > Search for **Email** > Click into the domain you created and find the email address that you created earlier > Send an email from your personal email to that email address to test

2. Navigate to the **Interactions** Pane on the left side of the screen and ensure you are set to **On-Queue** (found at top right of screen)
