Customers often want to contact businesses in the same way they would contact friends and family. SMS allows for a more convienent, asynchronous mode of communication. Using SMS, customers can avoid calling and waiting on hold for an available agent. SMS also allows customers to engage "on the go" without a dedicated mobile app. Also, because customers engage by SMS at faster rates than any other messaging channel, the organization can resolve issues more quickly.
