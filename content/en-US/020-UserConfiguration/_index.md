## Objective

By the end of this section you will know how to add people to your organization, edit profiles, assign roles and permissions. Standard roles will be available out-of-the-box, but additional hybrid roles can be created by an Admin. With roughly 1600 permissions in Genesys Cloud CX, a role can be very granular with what the user can access in the platform. Permissions allow users to do various tasks, such as create groups, set up integrations, and supervise contact center activity. The tools needed for a user to complete their day-to-day activities will be available, while shielding them from sensitive or non-essential information.
