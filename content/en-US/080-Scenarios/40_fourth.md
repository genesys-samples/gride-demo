#### [] Get up and ask a fellow agent <br> 
#### [] **Check your canned responses** <br> :white_check_mark:

#### [] Blind Transfer <br>
#### [] Put Betty on hold and call your manager to fix the order <br>
#### [] Hang Up and have the correct team call her back <br>
#### [] **Consult Transfer** <br> :white_check_mark:

#### In this scenario, consult transfer is your best option. Betty's explanation was long and complicated, and its best if you brief the agent before transferring. This will ensure the next agent has all the appropriate information, and that Betty doesn't have to repeat herself!
