## Web Chat Troubleshooting 

If Web Message interactions are not being routed to the correct agent/queue or are not appearing in the interaction pane, please walk through the following troubleshooting tips:

* [Confirm agent is a member of the queue that was created at the beginning of the workshop](https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/gride-demo/040-inbound-voice/10_first.html)

* [Confirm the Demo Extension Tool has the "Web Messaging" box checked"](https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/gride-demo/050-web-chat/10_first.html)

* [Confirm agent status is set to "On-Queue"](https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/gride-demo/050-web-chat/20_second.html)

 If interactions are still not being routed correctly, please reach out to us at Workshops@genesys.com.
