## Genesys Cloud Web Chat

The web chat channel is an invaluable tool for communicating and engaging with customers to provide better service for answering questions, completing orders, general guidance on companyâ€™s product and features, and personalized customer support. With this solution, Genesys improves handle time, first contact resolution, agent utilization, and customer satisfaction.

#### Widgets
Genesys offers three native versions of widgets as well as the option to integrate to a third party. Different versions of the widgets come with different benefits and features that you can enable. We recommend that you check out our comparison doc for our chat widgets. https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/widget-feature-comparison/ 

Widgets allow you to add web chat to your website so customers can chat with agents directly from their browsers. When you create a widget in the Genesys Cloud CX Admin console, a deployment key will be created. The deployment key will help identify the configuration settings for the widget when you put the widget onto your website. 

Having a website is not a prerequisite for this workshop. Instead, we will be routing chat interactions from the Genesys Cloud CX Developer center. Within our developer center we offer a large assortment of different tools for developers which can be found at this link. https://developer.genesys.cloud/developer-tools/ We'll be navigating to this section later in our workshop in the "Test the Interactions" section.
