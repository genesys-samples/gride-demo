# Activating Your Account

1. ## Open your welcome email and click the link to activate the account. 
- The link will navigate you to the initial account creation screen requesting company  name, email and password for the initial account. It is recommended that you enter in a shared account for this initial setup, instead of a personal account, to simplify recovery for future users

2. ## Admin > Genesys Add Ons > Find the Genesys Cloud Voice Tile and ensure it is active
![Activate ](/images/activate.jpg)

- This should be enabled by default, however non GCV org orders will require manual activation <br>
- If activation is required, select the tile and activate GCV- this can take around 10 minutes to fully activate

Note: You may need to skip and come back to "Ensuring Genesys Cloud Voice is Activated" as making sure the proper roles and permissions have been assigned to the user may need to be accomplished first
