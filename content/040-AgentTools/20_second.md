*In this scenario you don't have to actually transfer Betty, but its helpful to know the different types of transfers and how they work.*

*Blind Transfer*- The blind transfer button allows you to transfer Betty quickly to another queue or agent. You're able to see an agent's availability beforehand. This scenario would be helfpul if it is a simple inquiry and the other agent doesn't need to know any information before the transfer happens.

*Hang-up*- When you're finished helping Betty, you can hit this button to end the call and begin your after-call work.

Genesys Cloud maintains a consistent user experience across the platform. For this reason, it is easy for agents to master the art of taking interactions. Scripts, customer profile, canned responses, notes, and adding wrap-up codes are exactly the same for digital and voice interactions.
