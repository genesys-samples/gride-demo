## Test an Email Interaction

1. The first step in testing an email interaction is ensuring you have the correct email address. Navigate to the admin page and search for "Email." Then click into the domain you created and find the email address that you created earlier. All we need to do is send an email from our personal email to that email address! Go ahead and do that now.

2. Navigate to the Interactions pane on the left side of the screen and ensure you are set to "On-Queue" (found at top right of screen)
