## Test an Incoming Voice Interaction
The first step in testing a voice interaction is ensuring you have the correct inbound voice number to dial.
1. Navigate to the **Admin** page > Search for **Call Routing**> Find the call route that you set up earlier and save the phone number to your mobile device

2. Navigate to the **Interactions** pane on the left side of the screen and ensure you are set to **On-Queue** (found at top right of screen)

3. Dial the DID number from a personal phone, select option "1" when you hear the IVR, and select **answer** when the interaction comes through on the agent interaction pane.
