## Genesys Cloud Voice

Genesys Cloud Voice is an Internet-based telephony service that you can activate for use with your Genesys Cloud organization. It provides public telephony access to any Genesys Cloud services to which you subscribe, such as Communicate or the Genesys Cloud call center.

You can purchase phone numbers from us or you can bring phone numbers with you. When you have phone numbers in the Genesys Cloud Voice system, you can assign them to users, IVR systems, managed phones, or campaigns.

While the actual DID number purchase operation is a straightforward procedure, there are certain restrictions that apply to the numbers you can purchase. These [restrictions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/purchase-did-numbers/) are based on your AWS region.
