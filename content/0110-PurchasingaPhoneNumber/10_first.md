## Genesys Cloud Voice

Genesys Cloud Voice is an Internet-based telephony service that you can activate for use with your Genesys Cloud organization. It provides public telephony access to any Genesys Cloud services to which you subscribe, such as Communicate or the Genesys Cloud call center.

You can purchase phone numbers from us or you can bring phone numbers with you. When you have phone numbers in the Genesys Cloud Voice system, you can assign them to users, IVR systems, managed phones, or campaigns.

While the actual DID number purchase operation is a straightforward procedure, there are certain restrictions that apply to the numbers you can purchase. These [restrictions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/purchase-did-numbers/) are based on your AWS region.

Important for todays workshop, Architect also has an export and import option. What this will allow us to do is to simply give you a downloadable file for an architect flow and then you can simply import that file into your architect flow in your instance of Genesys Cloud CX. Architect is a powerful tool and it's very fun to learn how to build Architect flows from scratch, but it is not the objective in today's workshop. We will save that for another day!
