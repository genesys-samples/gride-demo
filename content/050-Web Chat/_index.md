## Objective

Genesys Cloud web messaging provides customers with an enhanced experience when they visit your website. Unlike web chat, which provides short-lived, standalone chats, web messaging enables a visitor to enter your site, converse with a bot or agent, and return later to pick up the conversation. With Predictive Engagement, agents can view the entire customer journey as part of the web messaging interaction. Web messaging shares many of the same features and capabilities as the other Genesys Cloud messaging channels that use ACD messaging to enable agents to respond to customer interactions.

By the end of this section, you will have a functional inbound web messaging channel. We'll walk through messenger configurations and deployment options. Lastly, we'll identify interaction tools and how to troubleshoot any issues that may come up.
