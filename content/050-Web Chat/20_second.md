## Test a Chat Interaction

1. The first step in testing a chat interaction visiting our web chat developer tool at the [Genesys Cloud CX Developer Center](https://developer.genesys.cloud/developer-tools/#/webchat)

2. First you'll need to login to your Genesys Cloud instance by clicking on your profile picture. Then navigate to the Deployment dropdown and ensure you have selected the "G-Ride" Deployment and ensure the ""Queue" field is set to "G-Ride." You can then put in any customer data if you like and then press start chat.
