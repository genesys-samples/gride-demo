## Test a Message Interaction

* As mentioned, using the Genesys Demo Extension tool allows customers to envision what an interaction widget may look like on their website. The tool will work on the majority of websites, but for todays demo lets use our Resource Center, help.mypurecloud.com

* Once on the website, click the extension tool icon on your toolbar. Click both **Start Inspecting** & **Start Injecting**. You'll now notice a clickable blue message icon on the bottom-right of the page. From here we can initiate a web message. Keep in mind, additional functionality can be added, such as launch behavior, authentication, attachments, and knowledge.

* Since we do not have any self-service set up for today's demo, a simple message from the user will be immediately escalated to a live agent. Make sure your agent is "On-Queue" before beginning your interaction.

* Finally, select **answer** when the chat interaction comes through
