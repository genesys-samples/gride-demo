In this scenario, you are a customer service agent. You have gone through 2 weeks of training and it is your first day alone on the job! Betty, your customer, has messaged in and is asking you about your return policy. You think the answer is that customers can return items within 90 days of purchase, but you're not sure...what should you do?
