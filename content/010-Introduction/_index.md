![Title](/images/title.jpg)
## Objective

This workshop is intended to take you from activating your Dev Lab to answering your first call . You will learn what tools agents have at their disposal when handling the interactions and how to best leverage those tools. 



**Notes before you start**:
* It is recommended to use search functionality in the admin panel vs. manually trying to navigate to any of the admin sections (Please see image below)

* It is highly recommended to use naming conventions when creating any items (other than location, site, and base settings) to ensure you are not developing over colleague deployments. Ex: JaneDoe_Queue or JaneDoe_Inboundflow, etc
