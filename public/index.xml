      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get ready   Step One: Go to the top right corner of the Genesys Cloud CX application (either browser or desktop) and toggle the on-queue switch to on. This turns the user&amp;rsquo;s status to on-queue and available for routing interactions in all queues that the user is active in.
  Step Two: You need to do two things to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re ready to start receiving interactions:
Go to the user profile in the top left corner, and verify: (1) you have a phone/endpoint selected (this will typically be webRTC) and (2) hit the activate queues button and ensure you&amp;rsquo;re activated in the queue you created.</description>

      <description>Scenario The purpose of this scenario is to showcase utilization and how we can manage an omnichannel approach.
  If not already on-queue, toggle the on-queue switch so that your status is &amp;ldquo;on-queue.&amp;rdquo; From here, we&amp;rsquo;re going to trigger two interaction types - email, and chat.
  Send an email to the email address domain you created within the Genesys Cloud CX admin panel. If set up appropriately, it will route directly to the &amp;ldquo;G Ride&amp;rdquo; Queue and to your user in the Agent Interface.</description>

With this solution, Genesys improves handle time, first contact resolution, agent utilization, and customer satisfaction.

      <description>Genesys Cloud SMS Customers often want to contact businesses in the same way they would contact friends and family. SMS allows for a more convienent, asynchronous mode of communication. Using SMS, customers can avoid calling and waiting on hold for an available agent. SMS also allows customers to engage &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo; without a dedicated mobile app. Also, because customers engage by SMS at faster rates than any other messaging channel, the organization can resolve issues more quickly.</description>

      <description>Scenario   Call the phone number purchased earlier that&amp;rsquo;s tied to the call flow uploaded. In the IVR, you will hear the prompt and then be routed to queue. If your user is on-queue, the interaction will be routed to you and interrupt the digital interactions.
NOTE: If you&amp;rsquo;re calling from the phone number listed on your user profile, the interaction will not route to you. Please ensure that the ANI you&amp;rsquo;re calling from is separate than the primary voice number listed in GCCX.</description>

      <description>Genesys Cloud Email Email is still one of the most reliable and desired ways for customers to interact with companies for support. Genesys Cloud CX automatically distributes emails to the best-fit agent based on content analysis and keywords. Genesys Email Routing streamlines your response process using email automation functionality that enables you to monitor, measure, and optimize your email flow to create a better customer experience.
Genesys Cloud routes incoming email messages through ACD just like it routes calls and chats, using the same routing and evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Omnichannel Experience</title>

      <description>Manual Outbound Interactions   You now have, at least, two-three interactions connected, and you&amp;rsquo;re learning the basics of an omnichannel experience. We&amp;rsquo;re going to throw one more interaction type into the mix. On the phone call, the customer requests that the contact center agent sends out a text message with specific information, such as a retail address, for them to quickly access.
  To complete this request, you need to go into the interaction pane and next to the conversations heading, there will be a &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; icon next to a human outline.</description>
